#Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
========================================================

##This analysis uses the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset V1.0
------------------

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate collecting, working with, and cleaning a data set. The result is a tidy data set that can be used for later analysis. 

Included is:  
1. a tidy data set as described below,  
2. a link to a Github repository with the script used for performing the analysis, and  
3. a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md.

##Description
------------------
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:
